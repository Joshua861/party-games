		<span slot="description">
			A random debate topic generator that will (hopefully) help you start a conversation with a
			group of friends. They range from more lighthearted topics like "Whats the best season?", to
			more <em>intense</em> topics like "The carbon tax would be effective for combatting climate
			change.
			<br /><br />
			These were curated from a liberal/left wing point of view, and questions like 'Abortion is a human
			right', and 'Gay marrage should be legal' have been removed (for being to obvious).
