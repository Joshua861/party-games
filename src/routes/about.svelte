<h2>
	<a href="/debates">Debate Topics</a>
</h2>

<p>
	A random debate topic generator that will (hopefully) help you start a conversation with a group
	of friends. They range from more lighthearted topics like "Whats the best season?", to more
	intense topics like "The carbon tax would be effective for combatting climate change.
</p>

<p>
	These were curated from a left wing point of view, and questions like 'Abortion is a human right',
	and 'Gay marrage should be legal' have been removed (for being to obvious). <a
